## How to use
Firstly, you need to clone this repository with the Inventory program and related text files to a local repository on your computer, so that you can access and run the program. If you need help, follow the instructions as set out github help webpage:

https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository You will also need to download the Python interpreter program onto your computer's operating system (OS) so that you can view and run the Task Manager code. The existing and generated text files can be viewed with a simple Notepad app which comes with Windows OS or you can download an appropriate Notepad app.

https://www.python.org/downloads/ - Navigate here to download the appropriate Python interpreter for your OS (i.e. Windows, Mac, Linux)

https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ - Navigate here to download Notepad for the text files if you don't already have it.

Once you have the Inventory files on your computer and you have succesfully downloaded Python and/or Notepad, you need to open the IDLE file within the Python programs on your pc that was downloaded automatically with Python. This is an Integrated Development Environment which allows you to view and run Python programs. When you open the IDLE file, a Python 'shell' window will appear. You can then click on the 'file' and 'open' tabs on the top toolbar to navigate to the 'taskmanager.py' python program file to open it. It will be displayed in another window separate to the shell window.

To run the program, select 'run' from the top toolbar and you can then interact with the task manager program in the shell window. Remember, if you choose to generate reports, the text files will be generated in the same folder as the local repository of files for this project and you can view them in Notepad if you wish to.

This program was worked on individually by myself to fulfill the sofware engineering bootcamp requirements. However, the helpful Hyperion Development mentors also reviewed and commented on the program!
